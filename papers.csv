2022,"Overcoming the limitations of COVID-19 diagnostics with nanostructures, nucleic acid engineering, and additive manufacturing","Nantao Li, Bin Zhao, Robert Stavins, Ana Sol Peinetti, Neha Chauhan, Rashid Bashir, Brian T. Cunningham, William P. King, Yi Lu, Xing Wang, Enrique Valera","Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science 26 (2022) 100966","The COVID-19 pandemic revealed fundamental limitations in the current model for infectious disease diagnosis and serology, based upon complex assay workflows, laboratory-based instrumentation, and expensive materials for managing samples and reagents. The lengthy time delays required to obtain test results, the high cost of goldstandard PCR tests, and poor sensitivity of rapid point-of-care tests contributed directly to society’s inability to efficiently identify COVID-19-positive individuals for quarantine, which in turn continues to impact return to normal activities throughout the economy. Over the past year, enormous resources have been invested to develop more effective rapid tests and laboratory tests with greater throughput, yet the vast majority of engineering and chemistry approaches are merely incremental improvements to existing methods for nucleic acid amplification, lateral flow test strips, and enzymatic amplification assays for protein-based biomarkers. Meanwhile, widespread commercial availability of new test kits continues to be hampered by the cost and time required to develop single-use disposable microfluidic plastic cartridges manufactured by injection molding","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cossms.2021.100966","COSSMS_2022.jpg"

We present an alternative approach for redox mediation based on branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI) modified with an osmium complex. This redox polyelectrolyte is crosslinked with phosphate to produce colloidal particles with a diameter of ca. 1 μm, which, combined with glucose oxidase (GOx), can form electroactive assemblies through either layer by layer assembly (LbL) or one-pot drop-casting (OPDC). The addition of NaCl to these colloidal systems induces the formation of films that otherwise poorly grow, presenting an outstanding catalytic current. The system was tested as a bioanode delivering a power output of 148 μW per nmol of mediator. These results are explained in terms of the interactions of the ions with the polyelectrolyte and represent a new route for the development of bioelectrochemical devices involving redox mediators and enzymes.","https://doi.org/10.1039/D1SM00221J","Enzymes hosted .gif"
2021,"Efficient decolorization of recalcitrant dyes at neutral/alkaline pH by a new bacterial laccase-mediator system","Lucy L Coria-Oriundo, Fernando Battaglini, Sonia Wirth","Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, 217, 112237 (2021)","Laccases and laccase-mediator systems (LMS) are versatile catalysts that can oxidize a broad range of substrates coupled to the sole reduction of dioxygen to water. They possess many biotechnological applications in paper, textile, and food industries, bioethanol production, organic synthesis, detection and degradation of pollutants, and biofuel cell development. In particular, bacterial laccases are getting relevance due to their activity in a wide range of pH and temperature and their robustness under harsh conditions. However, the enzyme and the redox mediator's availability and costs limit their large-scale commercial use. Here we demonstrate that β-(10-phenothiazyl)-propionic acid can be used as an efficient and low-cost redox mediator for decolorizing synthetic dyes by the recombinant laccase SilA from Streptomyces ipomoeae produced in E. coli. This new LMS can decolorize more than 80% indigo carmine and malachite green in 1 h at pH = 8.0 and 2 h in tap water (pH = 6.8). Furthermore, it decolorized more than 40% of anthraquinone dye remazol brilliant blue R and 80% of azo dye xylidine ponceau in 5 h at 50 °C, pH 8.0. It supported at least 3 decolorization cycles without losing activity, representing an attractive candidate for a cost-effective and environmentally friendly LMS functional at neutral to alkaline pH.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112237","1-s2.0-S0147651321003481-ga1.jpg"
2021,"Functionalized hierarchical wrinkled-silica spheres for laccases immobilization","Keyla M Fuentes, Lucy L Coria-Oriundo, Sonia Wirth, Sara A Bilmes","Journal of Porous Materials 28, 261-269 (2021)","Functionalized mesoporous SiO2 are common supports for some enzymes of industrial interest, such as laccases. However, the incorporation of specific functionalities and the loading of enzymes with dimensions close to the diameters of the pores obstructs the porous system. For biotechnological applications, tailored porous supports are still needed to enhance the laccase loading. The hierarchical meso/macroporous system in wrinkled-SiO2 spheres (w-SiO2) is a suitable option to overcome this issue. Herein, (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane and glutaraldehyde were use as functionalizing agents for the immobilization of laccase on w-SiO2. The functionalization occurs in the mesopores of the wrinkled walls and the preservation of the macroporous entries facilitates the diffusion of the laccase inside the particle. The enzyme performance was evaluated by means of the crystal violet bleaching. The enzyme is stabilized through the imine groups provided by glutaraldehyde, allowing the retention of the activity after several reaction cycles. The bleaching can be boosted by acetosyringone, highlighting the possibility of using redox mediators to expand the range of oxidizable substrates. Understanding the effect of w-SiO2 functionalization on laccases loading and performance could be extrapolated to other enzymes with biotechnological interest that requires this type of hierarchical porous silica.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10934-020-00988-9","Untitled drawing.jpg"

The biosensor was first tested for four E. coli strains against more than 90 non-E. coli strains routinely causing false positive results and showed high specificity towards E. coli strains. The biosensor was then determined for its detection sensitivity. It was observed that a single E. coli colony would generate a robust fluorescence signal after 2 h of sub-culturing. With this short incubation time, non-E. coli strains were unable to generate any apparent fluorescence signal, hence further improving the detection specificity of biosensor. Lastly, we further demonstrate that the biosensor can be applied to different commercial brands of simultaneous enzyme-based agar to consistently identify the presence of E. coli.
